Design Justification:

I designed a little introduction in order to show more worldbuilding and introduce the concept of the game. However, the majority of the game is contained within the Journey class. I did this simply because of ease and so I could have the game run smoothly. There are multiple methods and most of the game depends on the user actions and randomness. 

Alternate Design: 

I could have broken up the Journey class into smaller classes to prevent its vastness, but I am still not confident in my ability to do such complex coding, so I kept it in one class for right now. I also could have included more elements such as NPCs or more routes to take, but I didn't want to add too much and overwhelm myself for my first final project as a college student. 

What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

My overall approach to tackling this project was make it functional first, then add the bells and whistles. I found myself adding more elements as I went along and that delayed me from being productive. I added little comments as wrote to remind my later self to add functionality as well as other error checking. 

One new thing that I learned what do/while loop within methods to make sure that the user inputs the right commands for the game to work. Another new thing was returning values from methods to the main method to use them for if/else statements and keep the game running. 

I wish that I had implemented the wrong turn differently. I originally planned to keep track of original distance and make the user work back towards their original distance and then they could keep going, but it seemed too complicated so I just added distance to the number of miles needed instead. 

If I had more time, I would implement NPCs, more items to pick up, and more routes that the user could choose such as different end locations or different start locations. Furthermore, I would include a time limit as to make resting more sacrifical and make it so it can only be used if necessary. I feel like that would definitely raise the stakes. 

The most helpful feedback I received was "Know your limits." I received this advice from my dad when I was talking about this project with him. I feel like I definitely adhered to this advice and I thank him for his support, otherwise I would have been very, very overwhelmed. 

The hints I would give is to take little bites at a time. This project will be long, so don't try to get it all done at once. Another hint would be to not use RuntimeExceptions as they break the game and instead use loops. 

Overall, this was a fun project that I will be revisiting later. I have a lot of ideas that I could implement like the NPCs, etc. I had a great semester and thanks for being such great professors! Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!
